## How to Run the Project (Development Mode)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
Navigate to the project folder:


cd RNchallenge
Run the app with both frontend and backend concurrently:


npm run dev
This script launches both the Express server and React app in development mode.

Open your browser at:

http://localhost:3000
Make sure MongoDB is running locally on the default port (mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017).

Available Scripts
npm run dev: Starts frontend and backend in development mode.

npm run build: Builds the React frontend for production.

npm start: Starts the backend server in production mode.

Additional Notes
MongoDB must be installed and running locally.

The backend prevents duplicate users by enforcing a unique index on name, surname, country, and birthday.

To modify MongoDB connection settings, adjust /server/app.js or /server/server.js.

Frontend communicates with backend via REST API using Axios.
